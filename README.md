# dog-emotion-classification project by HTW Students



The Dog Emotion Classification AI is a machine learning project that aims to accurately classify the emotions of dogs based on input images. By leveraging deep learning techniques and a trained model, the AI system can analyze images of dogs and predict their emotional states.

## Features

Emotion Classification: The AI model can classify dogs into different emotional states such as happy, sad, excited, calm, etc.
Image Input: The system accepts images of dogs as input for emotion classification.
Pre-Trained Model: The AI system utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of labeled dog images to ensure accurate predictions.

## Installation

 Clone the repository:
 `git clone https://github.com/FurkanSelimKalkan/dog-emotion-classification.git
` and Install the required dependencies (Python 3.9)

Create a 'log' directory to place the pre-trained model weights into
and place them in the  directory.

## Usage

Ensure you have installed all the dependencies and downloaded the pre-trained model weights.

Run the main script:
Run the main script within [main.py](main.py). Dont forget to add your image
path in [config.py](config.py). 

The AI model will analyze the input image and display the predicted emotion of the dog.
